        "notes": "I love fast-paced, dev, shipping, and customer focused work environments: the less corporate slop, the better :) + I love FE focused Full-Stack dev, but I love to do ANYTHING to get it done: tech stacks are just a means-to-an-end. Will be graduating in Dec'25 and am defending my thesis, otherwise, I would have LOVED to play around with the challenge more: maybe NOAA NOMAD wind dataset for visualization and balloon location prediction! ALSO IMP: For the \"portfolio\", I would love to show you my Thesis project, but I cannot publicly give access to that link since [1] it needs HPC Cluster and [2] Need to keep my Research private until published (targetting HPDC 2026). However, if we could setup a meeting, I would love to show you around! Meanwhile, my portfolio website has a bit of info on it, and also a blog.",
