## Windborne Constellation Challenge

Using Three.js, plot constellation balloons on a globe, with trajectory plotting.

I would love to use NOAA's NOMAD wind dataset to plot wind data on top of the globe to visualize wind and maybe even predict and plot future locations of balloons. 

I unfortunately cannot just yet, focusing on thesis defense :(

Click on a balloon to show it's 24h trajectory!

Using cors.lol to bypass CORS, so I'd avoid being rate limited
